### Phase 7: RESTful Refactoring - POST to GET (Completed)

**Goal:** Convert `/search` endpoint to follow industry-standard RESTful patterns

**Motivation:**
- Inspired by **Car Select API** pattern
- GET is semantically correct for read operations
- Better caching, bookmarking, and developer experience
- Industry standard (Google Search, GitHub API, etc.)

**BREAKING CHANGE:** This is a major API change

**Before (POST):**
```bash
POST /search
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "query": "cheapest internet",
  "budget_max": 100,
  "include_internet": true
}
```

**After (GET):**
```bash
GET /search?query=cheapest%20internet&budget_max=100&include_internet=true
```

**Benefits of GET Pattern:**

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **RESTful** | Follows REST principles (GET for reads) |
| **Cacheable** | HTTP caching works automatically |
| **Bookmarkable** | Users can save/share search URLs |
| **Browser Testing** | Can test directly in browser |
| **Better DX** | Simpler for API consumers |
| **Standard** | Matches Google, GitHub, Car Select APIs |

**Changes Made:**

1. **OpenAPI Specification (`openapi.yaml`):**
   - Changed `/search` from `post` to `get`
   - Converted request body to 17 query parameters
   - Added detailed parameter documentation:
     - Price & Budget: `budget_min`, `budget_max`
     - Internet: `internet_speed_min`
     - Mobile: `mobile_data_min`
     - Services: `include_tv`, `include_mobile`, `include_internet`
     - Household: `family_size`
     - Features: `include_netflix`, `include_sports`
     - Sorting: `sort_by`, `sort_order`
     - Pagination: `limit`
   - Organized parameters by category
   - Enhanced descriptions with min/max constraints
   - Added examples with URL encoding

2. **FastAPI Implementation (`app/main.py`):**
   - Changed `@app.post` → `@app.get`
   - Replaced `SearchRequest` model with individual `Optional` parameters
   - Added sorting parameters (`sort_by`, `sort_order`)
   - Updated docstrings with GET examples
   - Updated root endpoint to show GET method

3. **Documentation (`docs/AI_AGENT_SEARCH_GUIDE.md`):**
   - Updated all 20+ code examples from JSON to GET URLs
   - Added benefits section
   - Updated integration code:
     ```python
     # Before
     requests.post(url, json=data)
     
     # After
     requests.get(url, params=data)
     ```
   - Updated all natural language examples with URL encoding
   - Updated all structured search examples
   - Updated all 5 common use cases

**Commits:**
```
f97e381 - refactor: Convert /search endpoint from POST to GET (RESTful pattern)
```

**Migration Impact:**

**Preserved:**
- ✅ All existing parameters
- ✅ Natural language query support
- ✅ Response format (SearchResponse unchanged)
- ✅ AI agent integration (just change method)
- ✅ Result ranking and scoring

**Changed:**
- ❌ HTTP method: POST → GET
- ❌ Request body → Query parameters
- ❌ Content-Type header no longer needed

**Lesson Learned:**
> Following established industry patterns (Car Select API) leads to better API design. GET for search operations is RESTful, cacheable, and provides better developer experience. Breaking changes are acceptable when they significantly improve the API design, but must be clearly documented.

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### 1. Search Endpoint Design

**Decision:** Unified search endpoint instead of separate product/bundle endpoints

**Rationale:**
- AI agents need one place to find all relevant offerings
- Reduces complexity for consumers
- Allows intelligent bundling and cross-product recommendations
- Better ranking across different result types

**Trade-offs:**
- More complex backend logic
- Larger response payloads
- ✅ Accepted for better AI agent experience

---

### 2. GET vs POST for Search

**Decision:** Changed from POST to GET after initial implementation

**Rationale:**
- REST principles: GET for read operations
- Cacheability (HTTP caching)
- Bookmarkable URLs
- Industry standard (Google, GitHub, Car Select)

**Trade-offs:**
- Breaking change for existing consumers
- URL length limits (rare with our parameters)

## 📚 Key Lessons Learned

### Technical Lessons

1. **API Design Matters Early**
   > Getting the HTTP method right (GET vs POST) from the start saves refactoring later. Study industry patterns before implementing.

2. **OpenAPI Specification is Essential**
   > Writing OpenAPI spec alongside code ensures documentation stays current and enables automatic tooling (SDKs, validation, docs).

3. **Cloud Platforms Change**
   > Render's PostgreSQL plan deprecation taught us to always check current platform documentation. Cloud services evolve rapidly.

4. **Real Data Improves Development**
   > Having `orange_full.json` with real products made development more realistic and caught edge cases early.

5. **Parameter Organization Matters**
   > Grouping query parameters by category (Price, Services, Features) in OpenAPI spec improves readability dramatically.

### Process Lessons

1. **Document as You Go**
   > Writing `AI_AGENT_SEARCH_GUIDE.md` during implementation caught design issues and forced clear thinking about use cases.

2. **Commit Messages are Documentation**
   > Detailed commit messages (like our POST→GET refactor) serve as architectural decision records (ADRs).

3. **Breaking Changes Need Clear Communication**
   > When making breaking changes (POST→GET), document migration path and preserve what can be preserved.

4. **Reference Successful APIs**
   > Car Select API provided excellent pattern to follow. Learning from established APIs accelerates good design.

5. **Structure Before Scale**
   > Starting with proper repository structure (`app/`, `tests/`, `docs/`) makes scaling easier.

### AI Agent Integration Lessons

1. **Explainability is Key**
   > AI agents need to explain their recommendations. Providing match reasons and scores enables this.

2. **Natural Language Support Improves UX**
   > Users prefer "cheapest internet for family" over structured filters. Support both.

3. **Ranked Results with Top Recommendations**
   > Providing explicit top 3 recommendations helps agents make confident suggestions.

4. **Response Format Matters**
   > Structured, consistent responses are easier for AI agents to parse and present to users.

### Design Patterns That Worked

1. **Unified Search Endpoint**
   > One endpoint for all search needs simplifies AI agent integration

2. **GET with Rich Query Parameters**
   > Follows REST, enables caching, improves DX

3. **Relevance Scoring (0-100)**
   > Clear scoring system helps rank and compare results

4. **Bundle Auto-Generation**
   > Automatically creating bundles from products reduces complexity for agents

5. **Metadata in Responses**
   > Including `search_criteria` in response helps agents understand what filters were applied
